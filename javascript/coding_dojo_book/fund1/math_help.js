// Q: Cartman doesn't really like math class and needs help. You are given two numbers -- the coefficiensts M and B in the equation Y = Mx + B build a function that returns the X-intercept  (you younger cousin reminds you that X- intercept is the value of x where y is equal to zero).


function xIntercept(m, b) {
  //y = mx + b
  return (0 - b) / m
}
